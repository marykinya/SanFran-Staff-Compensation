# SanFran-Staff-Compensation

- The Data is sourced from [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Employee-Compensation/88g8-5mnd) which is an open data platform that provides datasets shared by various institutions \n
    - The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013
    - There's an API endpoint option but I opted to download the CSV instead 
- The dataset is vast, running over a period of 9 years and the focus area is HR analytics
